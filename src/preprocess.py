"""
Data loading and preprocessing pipeline construction.

Design decision: preprocessing is expressed as a sklearn ColumnTransformer
rather than manual pandas transforms + separately saved encoders. This
guarantees:
  1. No train/test leakage: when wrapped in a Pipeline and passed to
     GridSearchCV, the transformer is re-fit on ONLY the training fold
     at every CV split, automatically -- not once on the full dataset.
  2. No train/inference mismatch: the exact same fitted object is reused
     at prediction time (loaded from the saved model), so there is no
     risk of the API applying a differently-ordered or differently-fit
     encoding than what the model was trained on.
  3. Consistent column order: ColumnTransformer always applies transforms
     to named columns, not positional indices, so column reordering in
     incoming data can never silently misalign features.
